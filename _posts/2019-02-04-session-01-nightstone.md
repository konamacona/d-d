We played the first session of the new campaign tonight! Here's what happened:

## Developments

Gelvira, Cretin, and Lustrum came to Nightstone for goblins, goblins, and an ancient tome. They met at the entrance of the seemingly deserted town as the town’s temple bell rang on and on. The investigated, killing the goblins ringing it. As they look around the town it is indeed deserted, with large stones littering the landscape, even having collapsed or holed many buildings. They also note a large 5ftx5ftx5ft hole in the centre of town.

They explored the town further and killed more Goblins, eventually finding a “monk” named Kella hiding at the Auchencairn inn. She tells them that rocks fell from the sky and she must have been knocked unconscious, when she woke up the townsfolk were gone and the goblins had invaded. She begs them to take her with them and they do.

The party continues on to fight two worg who nearly take out Cretin and begin to make their way towards the keep (leaving at least 1 goblin in the Stables and something rummaging in the Trading Post). Shortly after they find out Zella’s true identity and intentions, she’s a Zhentarim spy sent ahead to ready Nightstone for a Zhentarim takeover. She reveals that a group of Zhentarim are on their way to take over the village, but they don’t know about what’s happened and she doesn’t know when they’ll arrive. It was her job to ready the town for them.

Near to the (broken) bridge to the keep, the party finds a Tressym (winged cat) named Rillix hiding in a wrecked house. It takes a liking to Gelvira and follows her. Hissing at the flying snake of Kella’s that did the same. The party deftly creates a rope bridge across the bridge and makes their way up to the keep. Finding four guards milling around, seemingly still in shock. They tell them the following:

* Stones were from a cloud giant castle that floated over the town and attacked by throwing them down.
* The villagers fled to the caves to the north but guards and Lady Nandar were unable to follow because of the broken bridge.
* Lady Nandar was later crushed by one of the stones and perished, the guards want to get her to the Nandar tomb in the graveyard.
* Four giants came down took the Nightstone which was a black stone in the centre of town said to be a giant artifact of old.
* The guards want to fortify the town for the coming Zhentarim incursion and will not follow the party into the caves. They’ll gladly accept their help getting into the town however.

The party gets to take a short rest in the keep before moving on and feels empowered after their experiences (they are now level 2!).

## Decrees

### Revised Ranger

Cretin is a [Revised Ranger](https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/UA_RevisedRanger.pdf) with everything that comes with that.

### Druid's Wild Shape

Gelvira will be able to choose 10 beasts within the restrictions (1/4 CR, no flying/swimming) that she "knows" for the purposes of wild shape. They should be reasonable considering her background and chosen druidic circle. She'll also get to choose 5 more at levels 4 and 8 when the restrictions change. Finally she can add creatures to this list by defeating (by combat or otherwise) them in an encounter or having at least a 5 minute period of time to study a calm creature.

### Pets

Pets (such as the flying snake and Tressym) will be non-combat by default and untargetable by typical NPCs. If they ever get used by PCs for combat this will be broken.

## Opportunity Attack Spells

Although during the session we allowed an opportunity attack to include a spell cast, this turned out to be incorrect and going forward won't be allowed.

## Area of Effect Spells

We ruled this correctly, but I think it's good to note; unless otherwise specified, a spell that affect to "all creatures" in an area will affect both player character and NPCs alike, regardless of alignment with the party.
