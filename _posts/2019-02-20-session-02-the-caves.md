## Details Past

When last we met,  Gelvira, Cretin, and Lustrum had mostly cleared the ruined town of Nightstone of it's goblin incursion. In it's wreckage they found the rogue agent Kella pretending to be a monk who was preparing for an incursion by her faction, the Zhentarim, she is now their prisoner. They also found the keep of Nightstone, the four remaining guards, and the dead Lady Valrosa. The guards told them that the townsfolk went to a cave in the north to hide, and while they'd love to help in any way they can, they must also protect the town from the incoming Zhentarim threat.


## Developments

* Guards go towards drawbridge with prisoner Kella to fortify the town.
* Guard tells team to take what they need from the Lionshield Coster trading post, but they'll need to settle things with the owner Morak when they find him.
* Team investigates trading post, kills a gobbo, and Cretin does some _shopping_ (Takes grappling hook - 2g, Healer's kit - 5g, health potion - 50gp, total: 57gp).
* Team leaves and sees 2-3 men on horseback fighting the guards (2 on ground, 2 in towers around drawbridge), several more on the opposite side now partially upturned drawbridge. This must be the Zhentarim.
* Team decides they don't care and heroically uses their new found grappling hook to escape the city to the east.
* Team nearly drowns crossing a river and Gelvira turns into a bear to help. They do escape the river and head towards the cave. The sounds of combat from the town subsided as they escaped the river.
* Failing to sneak into the dark cavern (they are sopping wet and Gelvira is still a bear) they encounter 4 goblins firing arrows at them and an ogre, and eventually another ogre. They narrowly kill them all.
* Gelvira sends Rillix (the tressym) into a part of the cave where she smelled something off and Rillix returns with the info that a black oozy thing and some fresh water are back there. The team heroically avoids on Gelvira's advice.
* They head into tunnels in the west (split up) and reconnect just as they get surprise attacked by a goblin. They kill him just as another comes around the corner, but Gelvira (turned bear again) is able to intimidate her. The team hears more enemies (growling, gobbos talking) around the corner but backs off a bit, especially since from the enemies perspective they only saw a bear and wouldn't think they are intruders beyond that.

## Decrees

### Wild Shape Hit Points

When Gelvira uses wild shape she will always rolls fresh health stats for the beast in question. This is to represent that she's not turning into the same creature every time and that results may vary.

### Hit dice

Just a quick clarification / look-up; when take a short rest you can use as many hit dice as you like (as long as you have them to use). Each time gaining your constitution modifier as well.

### Critical Hits

In an effort to make critical hits feel more meaningful going forward instead of getting an additional damage dice, you add the max value of 1 damage dice.

Example: you crit and would normally change your `1d8 + 1` damage roll into a `2d8 + 1`; instead your roll becomes `1d8 + 1 + 8 --> 1d8 + 9`.
