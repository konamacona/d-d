## Details Past

When last we met,  Gelvira, Cretin, and Lustrum had mostly cleared the ruined town of Nightstone of it's goblin incursion. In the wreckage they found the rogue agent Kella pretending to be a monk who was preparing for an incursion by her faction, the Zhentarim, she is now their prisoner. They also found the keep of Nightstone, the four remaining guards, and the dead Lady Valrosa. The guards told them that the townsfolk went to a cave in the north to hide, and while they'd love to help in any way they can, they must also protect the town from the incoming Zhentarim threat.
