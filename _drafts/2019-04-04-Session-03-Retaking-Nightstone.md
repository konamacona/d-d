## Days Past

When last we met, our heroes Gelvira, Cretin, and Lustrum had herocially set out from the ruined town of Nightstone as it was being invaded by the Zhentarim. They made their way to a cave north of the village to try to find the villagers who had fleed the town during a rain of stones from the sky. Failing to sneak into the caves they fought off a mating pair of ogres and several goblins which were camped out inside the cave mouth. Afterward Gelvira sent her new found Tressym friend Rillix down a dark cavern only to find a black ooze of some sort in wait. Again the team heroically avoids the conflict and explores another set of caverns which come together, just as they meet up Gelvira was attacked and they fight off another Goblin foe, but someone else in the dark cave heard this fight and came to investigate. Gelvira pretends to be a normal bear and trys to scare off the cave dweller and the team flees to the larger cavern in the hopes that the investigating foe will think it was simply an invading bearâ€¦ but what will happen next?

## Developments

- Team & Gelvira flee to the mouth of the cave but 2 Goblin Guards and 3 Giant Rats follow.
- The heroes take out all but one rat when what seems to be the goblin boss, Hark appears with 2 more rats
- Cretin takes aim to fire as soon as he exits the cave.
- Hark exits as he begins trying to negotiate and takes an arrow to the shoulder, wounding him badly.
- Hark continues to try to worm his way out of the fight, talking the team into stopping at least for now; in exchange he will give them back the people of Nightstone
- Gelvira mentions the black ooze and Hark offers a bauble if they're able to defeat it.
- The townspeople start filing out from the back of the cave and the group meets the town figurehead and shop owner Morak Ur'grey
- He urges them to help him get back the town, and looks especially crushed (hehe) when he finds out Lady Nandar has died.
- Morak and the townspeople camp outside the caves with some supplies from the group and ready what few men they have for an attack to take back the town.
- The Party ventures down and kills the ooze, it nearly takes out Lustrum 
- Cretin negotiates with Hark that his goblins will keep the womena nd children safe while they're gone.
- Krenalla Downsbridge is a amazonian looking woman from the town who claps Cretin on the back (hard) as he tells Morak this and tells he the "Not all women need protection my friend".
- Krenalla, Morak, The Party, and 9 other good men from the town head towards Nightstone to take it from the Zhentarim
